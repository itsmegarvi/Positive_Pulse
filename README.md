# Positive Pulse

## Inspiration
As we know that healthcare providers burnout is a serious issue that affects many people working in the healthcare industry. It can result from a combination of factors, including long and demanding work hours, high levels of stress and responsibility, exposure to traumatic events, and a lack of control over one's work environment. Tweeting about burnout can provide a sense of community and help healthcare providers feel less isolated in their struggles. So, we are trying to find the tweets which are related to burnout and give them a positive automated reply so they can feel a little sense of relaxation.

## What it does
With Positive Pulse we try to help and keep the healthcare providers motivated and not depressed and burnout. It is a small step on our part to keep the force that keeps us healthy and feel appreciated. Positive Pulse on Twitter replies to tweets which sound depressing or burnout with a positive appreciative tweet in return.
