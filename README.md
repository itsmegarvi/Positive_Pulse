We used Python and Tableau to get data driven insights on burnout in healthcare industry. We used NLP tools, sentiment intensity analyzer and tf-idf vectorizer to classify the tweet as a burnout or non-burnout tweet. Then, we created visuals for the same using wordcloud to find the words occuring most in burnout tweets. 

## Challenges we ran into
Getting a dataset. It was very diffcult to find the right dataset needed for the problem. This took quite a bit of our time.

## What we learned
